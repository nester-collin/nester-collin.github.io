<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! I'm Collin Nester, an 11th grader at Leon High School.</p>
<p>I don't like talking about myself, so this page won't be very long.</p>

<p>I can solve a Rubik's cube pretty quickly. That's pretty cool.</p>
<p>Usually I say I like coding, but I guess that's a bit of a given for a place like this.</p>
<p>My friend and I compete in a coding challenge every December called Advent of Code, and he's gotten further in the last two years, but I have high hopes for winning this year.</p>
<p>I'm taking calculus right now, which is a lot of fun. Applying everything I've learned in algebra overy the last four years is really satisfying.</p>

<p>I also started learning piano this year, which is also quite enjoyable.</p>

<p>¡Mira! ¡Un Gato! It's not my cat. But it is a cat nontheless.</p>
