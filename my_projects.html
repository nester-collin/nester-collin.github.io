<h3><a href="https://github.com/collin-nester/jeopardy">Jeopardy</a></h3>
<p>Me and my friend William Negus made a text-based Jeopardy 
    game in Python for the 2021 AP Computer Science Principles exam. 
    It took over two weeks to make, and I'm very proud of how I
    set up the questions and answers from external files instead 
    of hardcoding it into the game. It was the first time I'd 
    done anything like it in a semi-formal project, and took a
    lot of work to get right. Certainly not perfect, as it required
    four seperate for categories, questions, values, and answers 
    instead of one, but the formatting was not too unnatural.</p>
<h3><a href="https://github.com/collin-nester/hangman">Hangman</a></h3>
<p>I made a text-based hangman game in Python. It's pretty old, but I remember
    making it robust against unintended user inputs was pretty challenging.
    I used a lot of the things I learned from this to make Jeopardy more
    robust against misinputs.</p>
