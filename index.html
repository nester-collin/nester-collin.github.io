    <h1>Hello World</h1>
    <p>I'm Collin Nester.</p>
    <p>This isn't my first website, but it sure has been a while since the last.</p>
    <blockquote>I remember blockquotes were something I used a lot.</blockquote>
    <p class="blue_background">I made this shade of blue the background, which in hindsight was a terrible choice.</p>
    <p class="old_font">And I made it this font</p>
    <p class="blue_text">And I made the text this shade of blue.</p>
    <p class="blue_background blue_text old_font">So together, it looked like this.</p>
    <p><strong>Do strong and p tags stack? I don't remember</strong></p>
    <p class="other_person">It sure looks like they do</p>
    <p>Woah! Who are you?</p>
    <p class="other_person">I'm you from the once future, now past</p>
    <p>Cool. Can you do anything other than time travel</p>
    <p class="other_person">You expect something better than time travel?</p>
    <p>Not really. I was just hoping.</p>
    <p class="other_person"><a href="https://google.com">Anyway, here's this cool site I just found</a></p>
    <p>Google?</p>
    <p class="other_person">Yeah, I just found it the other day. It's so cool!</p>
    <p>Alright. Well, I have to go now. See you later.</p>
    <p class="other_person">Bye!</p>
